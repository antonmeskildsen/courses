# CDoc

A Markdown based document convert/parser/formatter used as the backend for the [courses](https://antonmeskildsen.github.io/courses/) project. It can convert between a few document types but is easily extensible and provides a simple mechanism for processing the content. It exists as a *library* and a *command-line-utility*.

The main goal of CDoc is to be as extensible and generic as possible to allow for easy adaptation to project specific requirements. Ideally, it aims to become similar to Pandoc but with many of its functionalities being delegated to extension writers.

The command-line-utility (which has not been implemented yet) is the simplest way to use the converter. It is the simplest way to integrate CDoc into another project.
