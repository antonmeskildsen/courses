# Code tools
Courses allows you to write solutions to code exercises inline with the same exercise text and placeholder code that should be published. It also allows you to configure automated export to several formats (e.g. HTML for the webpage and Jupyter Notebooks to be used for exercises). More than any other features, these make Courses distinct from similar tools.

It allows you to focus on writing content instead of managing and setting up individual tools.
