# Courses documentation

Courses is a publishing system for interactive content. 

- Supports both regular markdown documents and Jupyter Notebooks.
- Is made specifically for content involving exercises. Write a single source file that contains both exercise descriptions, solutions, and tests.
- Has as shortcode system that makes custom extensions easy to implement. (inspired by Hugo and Zola).

## Speed is a feature
Courses is fast enough to make a real-time editing workflow possible. The built-in automatic rebuild and reload mechanism makes any change to the source files appear almost instantaneously in the browser. Even full builds typically take less than a second to complete, even for large projects.

You should be able to focus on writing content. A faster tool gets out of your way and gives you feedback as you make changes.
