# Courses

Courses is a publishing system for interactive content.

- Supports both regular Markdown documents and Jupyter Notebooks.
- Is made specifically for content involving exercises. Write a single source file that contains both exercise 
  descriptions, solutions, and tests.
- Uses a simple template-like syntax (called shortcodes) for applying built-in and custom components, including 
  figures and admonitions.

## Speed is a feature
Courses is fast enough to make a real-time editing workflow possible. The built-in automatic rebuild and reload 
mechanism makes any change to the source files appear almost instantaneously in the browser. Even full builds 
typically take less than a second to complete, even for large projects.

You should be able to focus on writing content. A faster tool gets out of your way and gives you feedback as you 
make changes.
